# emubench 

This is a clean-up of an old (and fairly naive) emulation benchmark originally written back in 2010. This was originally hosted on bitbucket using mercurial but as I've moved to git and github since it was written I have moved it here.

You can see discussion around the benchmark and where it came from in this ngmeu thread from back in the day: https://www.ngemu.com/threads/switch-case-vs-function-table.137562/page-4#post-1893592
